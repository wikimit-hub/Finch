'''Finches''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, often [[seed]]-eating, found chiefly in the northern hemisphere and [[Africa]].  One subfamily is endemic to the [[Neotropics]].  The taxonomic structure of the true finch family, '''Fringillidae''', is somewhat disputed, with some including the Hawaiian honeycreepers as another subfamily ([[Drepanididae|Drepanidinae]]) and/or uniting the cardueline and fringilline finches as [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]s (Carduelini and Fringillini) in one subfamily; the euphonious finches were thought to be tanagers due to general similarity in appearance and mode of life until their real affinities were realized{{cn}}; the [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s and [[American sparrow]]s were formerly considered another subfamily (Emberizinae). [[Przewalski's Finch|Przewalski's "Rosefinch"]] (''Urocynchramus pylzowi'') is now classified as a distinct, [[monotypic]] family with no particularly close relatives{{cn}}.

"Classic" or true finches are small to moderately large and have a strong, stubby [[beak]]s, which in some species can be quite large.  All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries. They have a bouncing flight, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Their nests are basket-shaped and built in trees.

There are many birds in other families which are often called finches. These include many species in the very similar-looking  Estrildids or [[waxbill]] family, which occur in the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]. Several groups of the [[Emberizidae]] family (buntings and American sparrows) are also named as finches, including the [[Darwin's finches]] of  the [[Galapagos]] islands, which provided evidence of Darwin's theory of evolution.

==Systematics==
The systematics of the cardueline finches are contentious. The layout presented here follows the molecular studies of Marten & Johnson (1986) and Arnaiz-Villena ''et al.'' (1998, 2001), and takes into account the traditional splitting of the genus ''Carduelis''. The exact position of several genera in the cardueline sequence is tentative.
