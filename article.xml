'''Finches''' are [[seed]]-eating [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, the many [[species]] of which are found chiefly in the northern hemisphere but also to a limited extent in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. They are small to moderately large and have a strong [[beak]], usually [[cone|conical]] and in some species very large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries.

In addition to the species whose names indicate their relation with the group, such as the greenfinches and chaffinches, the finches include birds with distinctive names. The [[grosbeak|grosbeaks]], [[cardinal|cardinals]], [[brambling|bramblings]], [[siskin|siskins]], [[linnet|linnets]], [[redpoll|redpolls]], [[canary|canaries]] and [[crossbill|crossbills]] are all finches.

There are many other birds in other groups which are called finches, notably the very similar-looking  Estrilids or [[waxbill]], which occur in the Old World tropics and [[Australia]].

Some of the closely related [[sparrow]]s are also named as "finches".
