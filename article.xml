[[Aves]], [[Passeriformes]]. '''Finches''' are [[seed]]-eating birds of many [[species]] found chiefly in the northern hemisphere but also to a limited extent in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. They are small to moderately large and have a strong [[beak]], usually [[cone|conical]] and in some species very large.

In addition to the species whose names indicate their relation with the group, such as the greenfinches and chaffinches, the finches include birds with distinctive names. The [[grosbeak|grosbeaks]], [[cardinal|cardinals]], [[brambling|bramblings]], [[siskin|siskins]], [[linnet|linnets]], [[redpol|redpols]], [[sparrow|sparrows]], [[canary|canaries]] and [[crossbill|crossbills]] are all finches.
