The '''true finches''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Fringillidae'''. They have an world-wide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions. They are usually resident and do not migrate.

Many birds in other families are also commonly called "finches", including some [[species]] in the very similar-looking [[waxbill]]s or [[estrildid finch]]es (family [[Estrildidae]]) of the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]; several groups of the [[bunting (bird)|bunting]] and [[American sparrow]] family ([[Emberizidae]]); and the [[Darwin's finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] islands, now considered members of the [[tanager]] family (Thraupidae).<ref name = nc7393>Newton (1973), Clement ''et al.''

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The [[scientific name]] Fringillidae, comes from the [[Latin]] word ''fringilla'' for the [[common chaffinch]] (''Fringilla coelebs''),  a member of the family which is common in [[Europe]]. It was coined by the English zoologist [[William Elford Leach]] in 1820.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and nomenclature of avian family-group names| series= Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History Issue 222 | page=156 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/830 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | last=Leach | first=William Elford | author-link=William Elford Leach  | year=1820 | chapter=Eleventh Room | title= Synopsis of the Contents of the British Museum | place=London | publisher=British Museum | edition=17th| pages=65-70 | others=(published anonymously) }}<!--I was unable to find a scan of this online--></ref> The Fregatidae family is divided into three [[subfamilies]], the [[Fringillinae]] containing a single [[genus]] with the chaffinches, the [[Carduelinae]] containing 183 species divided into 49 genera, and the [[Euphoniinae]] containing the ''[[Euphonia]]'' and the ''[[Chlorophonia]]''.<ref name=Zuccon2012/>

The taxonomy of the finch family, in particular the cardueline finches, has a long and complicated history. The study of the relationship between the [[taxa]] has been confounded by the recurrence of similar morphologies due to the [[convergent evolution|convergence]] of species occupying similar niches.<ref name=Zuccon2012/> In 1968 the America ornithologist Raymond Andrew Paynter Jnr. wrote:
<blockquote>
Limits of the genera and relationships among the species are less understood - and subject to more controversy - in the carduelines than in any other species of passerines, with the possible exception of the estrildines [waxbills].<ref>{{ cite book | editor-last=Paynter | editor-first=Raymond A.

</blockquote>
Beginning in around 1990 a series of phylogenetic studies based on [[mitochondrial]] and nuclear DNA sequences resulted in substantial revisions being made to the taxonomy. Several groups of birds that had previously been assigned to other families were found to be related to the finches. The [[Neotropical]] ''[[Euphonia]]'' and the ''[[Chlorophonia]]'' were formerly placed in the tanager family [[Thraupidae]] due to their similar appearance but analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that both genera were more closely related to the finches. They are now placed in a separate subfamily [[Euphoniinae]] within the Fringillidae.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Banks | first1=Richard C. | last2=Cicero | first2=Carla | last3=Dunn | first3=Jon L. | last4=Kratter | first4=Andrew W. | last5=Rasmussen | first5=Pamela C. | last6=Remsen  | first6=J.V.

Although [[Przewalski's finch|Przewalski's "rosefinch"]] (''Urocynchramus pylzowi'') has ten [[Flight_feather#Primaries|primary flight feathers]], it was sometimes classified in the Carduelinae. It is now assigned to a distinct family, Urocynchramidae, monotypic as to genus and species, and with no particularly close relatives among the Passeroidea.<ref name=ioc/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Groth |first=J. |year=2000 |title=Molecular evidence for the systematic position of ''Urocynchramus pylzowi'' |journal=The Auk |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=787–792 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0787:MEFTSP]2.0.CO;2 |jstor=4089604 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/node/26265}}</ref>

[[Fossil]] remains of true finches are rare, and those that are known can mostly be assigned to extant [[genera]] at least. Like the other Passeroidea families, the true finches seem to be of roughly [[Middle Miocene]] origin, around 20-10 [[million years ago]] (Ma). An unidentifable finch fossil from the [[Messinian]] [[European land mammal age|age]], around 12 to 7.3 [[million years ago]] (Ma) during the [[Late Miocene]] subepoch, has been found at [[Polgárdi]] in [[Hungary]].<ref>Hír ''et al.''

==Description==
The smallest "classical" true finches are the [[Andean siskin]] (''Spinus spinescens'') at as little as 9.5&nbsp;cm (3.8&nbsp;in) and the [[lesser goldfinch]] (''Spinus psaltria'') at as little as {{convert|8|g|oz|abbr=on}}. The largest species is probably the [[collared grosbeak]] (''Mycerobas affinis'') at up to {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|83|g|oz|abbr=on}}, although larger lengths, to {{convert|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in the [[pine grosbeak]] (''Pinicola enucleator''), and weights, to {{convert|86.1|g|oz|abbr=on}} in the [[evening grosbeak]] (''Hesperiphona vespertinus''), have been recorded in species which are slightly smaller on average.<ref name="Clement">''Finches and Sparrows'' by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (1999). ISBN 978-0691048789.</ref><ref name = "CRC">''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'' by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), ISBN 978-0-8493-4258-5.</ref> They typically have strong, stubby [[beak]]s, which in some species can be quite large; however, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s are famous for the wide range of bill shapes and sizes brought about by [[adaptive radiation]]. All true finches have 12 [[remiges]] and 9 primary [[rectrices]]. The basic [[plumage]] colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s are commonplace in this family, and thus blue [[structural colour]]s are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong [[sexual dichromatism]], the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.<ref name = nc7393 />

==Distribution and habitat==
Finches are typically inhabitants of well-wooded areas, but some can be found on mountains or even in [[desert]]s. They are primarily [[granivorous]], but [[Euphoniinae|euphoniines]] include considerable amounts of [[arthropod]]s and [[berries]] in their diet, and Hawaiian honeycreepers [[evolution|evolve]]d to utilize a wide range of food sources, including [[nectar]]. The diet of Fringillidae [[nestling]]s includes a varying amount of small arthropods. True finches have a bouncing flight like most small [[passerine]]s, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings. Most sing well and several are commonly seen [[cagebird]]s; foremost among these is the [[domesticated]] [[Domestic Canary|canary]] (''Serinus canaria domestica''). The nests are basket-shaped and usually built in trees, more rarely in bushes, between rocks or on similar substrate.<ref name = nc7393 />

==List of genera==
The Fringillidae family contains 218 species divided into 52 genera and three subfamilies. The subfamily [[Carduelinae]] includes 14 extinct Hawaiian honeycreepers and the extinct [[Bonin grosbeak]].<ref name=ioc/>
