'''Finches''' are [[seed]]-eating [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, the many [[species]] of which are found chiefly in the northern hemisphere, but also to a limited extent in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. 

They are small to moderately large and have a strong [[beak]], usually [[cone (solid)|conical]] and in some species very large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Their nests are basket-shaped and built in trees.

A group of finches is called a ''charm''.
