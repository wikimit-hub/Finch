'''Finches''' are [[seed]]-eating [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, the many [[species]] of which are found chiefly in the northern hemisphere but also to a limited extent in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. They are small to moderately large and have a strong [[beak]], usually [[cone|conical]] and in some species very large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries.

In addition to the species whose names indicate their relation with the group, such as the greenfinches and chaffinches, the finches include birds with distinctive names. The [[grosbeak|grosbeaks]], [[cardinal|cardinals]], [[brambling|bramblings]], [[siskin|siskins]], [[linnet|linnets]], [[redpoll|redpolls]], [[canary|canaries]] and [[crossbill|crossbills]] are all finches.

The very similar-looking [[Australian]] birds of the family [[Passeridae]] are also usually called ''finches''. Strictly, this is incorrect: these 'finches' belong to the Estrildini or [[waxbill]] subfamily of the large and diverse Passeridae family (which also includes the [[sparrow]]s and [[weaver]]s), and are [[grass-finch]]es or [[mannikins]] of ultimately [[African]] origin.
