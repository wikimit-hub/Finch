'''Finches''' are [[seed]]-eating [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, the many [[species]] of which are found chiefly in the northern hemisphere, but also to a limited extent in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. 

They are small to moderately large and have a strong [[beak]], usually [[cone|conical]] and in some species very large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries. These birds have a strong flight and most sing well. Nests are basket-shaped and built in trees.

There are two main subfamilies. The first, the ''Fringillinae'', contains only three species, which feed their young insects rather than seeds:
*[[Chaffinch]] ''Fringilla coelebs''
*[[Blue Chaffinch]] ''Fringilla teydea''
*[[Brambling]] ''Fringilla montifringilla''

The much larger second group, the ''Carduelinae'' contains several genera which feed their young on seeds:
*''[[Serinus]]'', [[canary|canaries]], [[seedeater]]s and some [[siskin|siskins]] 
*''[[Carduelis]]'', [[linnet|linnets]],  [[redpoll|redpolls]], [[goldfinch]]es, [[greenfinch]]es, some siskins.
*''Carpodacus'', [[rosefinch]]es
*''Loxia'', [[crossbill|crossbills]]
*''Mycerobas'', [[grosbeak|grosbeaks]]
*''Neospiza'', [[Sao Tom&eacute; Grosbeak]]
*''Linurgus'', [[Oriole Finch]]
*''Rhynchostruthus'', [[Golden-winged Grosbeak]]
*''Leucosticte'', [[mountain finch]]es
*''Calacanthis'', [[Red-browed Finch]]
*''Rhodopechys'', [[trumpeter finch]]es
*''Uragus'', [[Long-tailed Rosefinch]]
*''Urocynchramus'', [[Przewalski's Rosefinch]]
*''Pinicola'', [[pine grosbeak]]s
*''Haematospiza'', [[Scarlet Finch]]
*''Neospiza'', [[Sao Tom&eacute Grosbeak]]
*''Pyrrhula'', [[bullfinch]]es 
*''Coccothraustes'', [[Hawfinch]]
*''Eophona'', [[oriental grosbeak]]s
*''Hesperiphona'', [[evening grosbeak]]s
*''Pyrrhoplectes'', [[Gold-naped Finch]]

There are many other birds in other groups which are called finches, notably the very similar-looking  Estrilids or [[waxbill]]s, which occur in the Old World tropics and [[Australia]].

Some of the closely related [[sparrow]]s are also named as "finches", as are some [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s.
