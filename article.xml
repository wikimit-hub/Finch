The '''true finches''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s in the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Fringillidae'''. They are predominantly [[seed]]-eating [[songbird]]s. Most are native to the [[Northern Hemisphere]], but one [[subfamily]] is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Neotropics]], one to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and one subfamily &ndash; [[monotypic]] at [[genus]] level &ndash; is found only in the [[Palaearctic]]. The [[scientific name]] Fringillidae comes from the [[Latin]] word ''fringilla'' for the [[common chaffinch]] (''Fringilla coelebs'') &ndash; a member of that last subfamily &ndash; which is common in [[Europe]].

Many birds in other families are also commonly called "finches", including some [[species]] in the very similar-looking [[waxbill]]s or [[estrildid finch]]es (family [[Estrildidae]]) of the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]; several groups of the [[bunting (bird)|bunting]] and [[American sparrow]] family ([[Emberizidae]]); and [[Darwin's finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] islands, which provided evidence of natural selection and are now recognized to be peculiar [[tanager]]s (Thraupidae).<ref name = nc7393>Newton (1973), Clement ''et al.'' (1993)</ref>

==Description==
[[File:DrepadinidaeSchnabel.jpg|thumb|left|Beak and tongue shapes of the [[Drepanidinae]]]]
The smallest "classical" true finches are the [[Andean siskin]] (''Carduelis spinescens'') at as little as 9.5&nbsp;cm (3.8&nbsp;in) and the [[lesser goldfinch]] (''C. psaltria'') at as little as {{convert|8|g|oz|abbr=on}}. The largest species is probably the [[collared grosbeak]] (''Mycerobas affinis'') at up to {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|83|g|oz|abbr=on}}, although larger lengths, to {{convert|25.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in the [[pine grosbeak]] (''Pinicola enucleator''), and weights, to {{convert|86.1|g|oz|abbr=on}} in the [[evening grosbeak]] (''Coccothraustes vespertinus''), have been recorded in species which are slightly smaller on average.<ref name="Clement">''Finches and Sparrows'' by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (1999). ISBN 978-0691048789.</ref><ref name = "CRC">''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'' by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), ISBN 978-0-8493-4258-5.</ref> They typically have strong, stubby [[beak]]s, which in some species can be quite large; however, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s are famous for the wide range of bill shapes and sizes brought about by [[adaptive radiation]]. All true finches have 12 [[remiges]] and 9 primary [[rectrices]]. The basic [[plumage]] colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s are commonplace in this family, and thus blue [[structural colour]]s are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong [[sexual dichromatism]], the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.<ref name = nc7393 />

Finches are typically inhabitants of well-wooded areas, but some can be found on mountains or even in [[desert]]s. They are primarily [[granivorous]], but [[Euphoniinae|euphoniines]] include considerable amounts of [[arthropod]]s and [[berries]] in their diet, and Hawaiian honeycreepers [[evolution|evolve]]d to utilize a wide range of food sources, including [[nectar]]. The diet of Fringillidae [[nestling]]s includes a varying amount of small arthropods. True finches have a bouncing flight like most small [[passerine]]s, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings. Most sing well and several are commonly seen [[cagebird]]s; foremost among these is the [[domesticated]] [[Domestic Canary|canary]] (''Serinus canaria domestica''). The nests are basket-shaped and usually built in trees, more rarely in bushes, between rocks or on similar substrate.<ref name = nc7393 />

==Systematics and taxonomy==
The [[taxonomic]] [[structure]] of the true finch family, Fringillidae, has been fairly disputed in the past, with some upranking the [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s (Drepanidinae) as family Drepanididae and/or uniting the cardueline and fringilline finches as [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]s (Carduelini and Fringillini) in one subfamily; the euphonious finches ([[Euphoniinae]]) were thought to be [[tanagers]] due to general similarity in appearance and mode of life until their real affinities were realized. In particular, [[North America]]n authors have often merged the [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s and [[American sparrow]] family ([[Emberizidae]]) &ndash; and sometimes the bulk of the [[nine-primaried oscine]]s &ndash; with the split-up Fringillidae as subfamilies of a single massive family. But the current understanding of [[Passeroidea]] [[phylogeny]] is better reflected in keeping the fundamental nine-primaried oscine [[clade]]s as distinct families. However, [[Przewalski's finch|Przewalski's "rosefinch"]] (''Urocynchramus pylzowi'') is now classified as a distinct family, monotypic as to genus and species, and with no particularly close relatives among the Passeroidea.<ref>Clement ''et al.'' (1993), Groth (2000), Jønsson & Fjeldså (2006), Arnaiz-Villena ''et al.'' (2007)</ref>

[[Fossil]] remains of true finches are rare, and those that are known can mostly be assigned to extant [[genera]] at least. Like the other Passeroidea families, the true finches seem to be of roughly [[Middle Miocene]] origin, around 20-10 [[million years ago]] (Ma). An unidentifable finch fossil from the [[Messinian]] [[European land mammal age|age]], around 12 to 7.3 [[million years ago]] (Ma) during the [[Late Miocene]] subepoch, has been found at [[Polgárdi]] in [[Hungary]].<ref>Hír ''et al.''

===Subfamilies and genera===
The systematics of the cardueline finches are contentious. The layout presented here follows the recent decades' [[molecular phylogenetic]] studies, and takes into account the traditional splitting of the genus ''Carduelis''. The exact position of several genera in the cardueline sequence is tentative.<ref>Marten & Johnson (1986), Arnaiz-Villena ''et al.'' (1998, 2001, 2007, 2008)</ref>
