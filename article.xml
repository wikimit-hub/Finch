'''Finches''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, often [[seed]]-eating, and occasionally cannibalistic, found chiefly in the northern hemisphere and [[Africa]]. One subfamily is endemic to the [[Neotropics]].  The family scientific name '''Fringillidae''' comes from the [[Latin]] word "fringilla", meaning [[chaffinch]], a member of this family that is common in Europe.  The taxonomic structure of the true finch family, Fringillidae, is somewhat disputed, with some including the Hawaiian honeycreepers as another subfamily ([[Drepanididae|Drepanidinae]]) and/or uniting the cardueline and fringilline finches as [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]s (Carduelini and Fringillini) in one subfamily; the euphonious finches were thought to be tanagers due to general similarity in appearance and mode of life until their real affinities were realized{{Fact|date=February 2007}}; the [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s and [[American sparrow]]s were formerly considered another subfamily (Emberizinae). [[Przewalski's Finch|Przewalski's "Rosefinch"]] (''Urocynchramus pylzowi'') is now classified as a distinct, [[monotypic]] family with no particularly close relatives (Groth 2000).

"Classic" or true finches are small to moderately large and have strong, stubby [[beak]]s, which in some species can be quite large.  All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries. They have a bouncing flight, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Their nests are basket-shaped and built in trees. The true finches range in size from the Andean Siskin (''Carduelis spinescens''), at 9.5 cm (3.8 inches) and 8.4 g., to the Collared Grosbeak (''Mycerobas affinis''), at nearly 23 cm (9 inches) and 79 g. (2.8 oz).

There are many birds in other families which are often called finches. These include many species in the very similar-looking  Estrildids or [[waxbill]] family, which occur in the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]. Several groups of the [[Emberizidae]] family (buntings and American sparrows) are also named as finches, as are [[Darwin's finches]] of  the [[Galapagos]] islands, which provided evidence of natural selection.

==Systematics==
The systematics of the cardueline finches are contentious. The layout presented here follows the molecular studies of Marten & Johnson (1986) and Arnaiz-Villena ''et al.'' (1998, 2001, 2007, 2008), and takes into account the traditional splitting of the genus ''Carduelis''. The exact position of several genera in the cardueline sequence is tentative.

==Cautions==
A new species of finch has recently been discovered in the midwest of the United States. Dubbed "the blood finch", it was discovered attacking small children in an elementary school.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} The terrifying thing about this finch is that it's virtually indestinguishable from the common yellow finch, with the exception of small red streaks down it's sides. This explains why it went virtually unnoticed taxonomically. As for current attempts at taxonomy, physical traits are very difficult to determine. The skeletal structure of all 50 specimens found was almost entirely destroyed, as the midwesterners don't take too kindly to school children coming home bleeding from their eyes. A local news report in the anonymous town (they are a popular tourist destination, and so requested anonymity) stated that "... the sounds of shot guns loaded with buckshot and salt filled the air [that afternoon]."

This species does not have a scientific name yet, as the protein sequence in the DNA is so strange for the species. It bares a striking resemblence to that of the peregrine falcon, as well as to various species of crocodile. It's behavior went unnoticed by scientists until the attack at the school, but this is because their environment was recently developed for more corn fields. It has been cited by various orthologists that they are highly aggressive, often to the point of killing when food is readily available. Various cats that have been found maimed in the area may have been killed by the finches. Previously attributed to vandals, the cats were found with their eyes pecked out to the point of brain damage. As no species has been found alive (as stated before, midwesterners like shot guns), there is no way to varify this information.

Before the attack, a swarm of finches was spotted near the school on a jungle gym. They watched the children from a distance, and when the school teachers went indoors, the birds took their chance to chase the children. The children were seen fleeing home with their jackets over their heads. Afterward, many of the non-finch birds in the area were found dead, with conditions similar to that of the maimed cats. Local birds nests were also attacked, as holes were found in the tops of those eggs. The albumen had seeped out the tops of the eggs in this fashion, and it is suspected that this was done to expand the finch's territory, and not for nutritional purposes.

For the Oklahoma area, a warning is currently in effect as result. If swarms of finches are seen in your area, stay indoors until the swarm passes. If possible, try to catch one for study. If you kill one, send the body to your local orthological society for study. They are highly dangerous, and due to the fact that they cannot be identified readily, all finches are subject to this ruling.
