'''Finches''' are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s, often [[seed]]-eating, found chiefly in the northern hemisphere and [[Africa]].  One subfamily is endemic to the Neotropics.  The finch family, Fringillidae, also contains the Hawaiian honeycreepers ([[Drepanididae|Drepanidinae]]).

"Classic finches" are small to moderately large and have a strong, stubby [[beak]]s, which in some species can be quite large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9 primaries. They have a bouncing flight, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Their nests are basket-shaped and built in trees.

There are many birds in other families which are often called finches. These include many species in the very similar-looking  Estrildids or [[waxbill]] family, which occur in the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]. Several groups of the [[Emberizidae]] family ([[bunting (bird)|buntings]] and [[American sparrow]]s) are also named as finches, including the [[Darwin's finches]] of  the [[Galapagos]] islands, which provided evidence of Darwin’s theory of evolution.
